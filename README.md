1. Customer Credit Behavior & Financial Analysis
You worked as a Financial Data Analyst, focusing on customer credit behavior. Using a Kaggle financial dataset, you:

Cleaned and transformed data in Excel using Power Query.

Segmented customers based on payment history, debt-to-income ratio, and delinquency.

Built dashboards with PivotTables, nested formulas, and conditional formatting.

Used What-If analysis to evaluate loan scenarios.

 Insight: Low credit score correlated strongly with delinquency and high debt ratios.

 Tools Used: Excel, Power Query

2. SQL-Based Data Analysis and Modeling
In this project, you performed data normalization and modeling using a relational dataset.

Structured data into multiple normalized tables (3NF).

Designed an ER diagram showing relationships.

Wrote complex SQL queries to extract trends and insights.

 Insight: Found peak sales months, top products, and regional buying patterns.

 Tools Used: MySQL/PostgreSQL, Excel (for visualization)

3. Retail Store Performance Analysis
This project simulated real-world retail analytics using sales and inventory data.

Normalized the retail dataset and created a clean schema.

Analyzed stock movements, seasonal demand, and sales trends using SQL.

Designed reports on inventory bottlenecks and regional performance.

 Insight: Products were often out-of-stock during festive seasons; South region had consistent growth.

Tools Used: SQL, Excel, ER diagram tools

4. Image to Excel Converter
Here, you built a tool that extracts structured data from unstructured images and outputs it in Excel format.

Used OCR (Optical Character Recognition) to read image text.

Parsed values like loan amount, guarantor name, interest rate, etc.

Mapped the output to Excel columns with downloadable .xlsx files.

 Insight: Template consistency greatly improves OCR accuracy and automation speed.

Tools Used: Python (Tesseract OCR, OpenCV), Pandas, Excel
